                Hello there! I'm Clement Zhang, a Computer Science new graduate from Toronto Metropolitan University 
                (formerly Ryerson University). I'm interested in software engineering and web development. 
                I'm currently looking for an internship. I made this website to showcase my skills in 
                React. In the future, I will improve the pages and add more content.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may notice that I use very little styling. In fact, the most noticeable styling is just the dark mode.
                My styling preferences are very minimalistic, so don't expect more than the minimum required styling to make
                major elements stand out from each other.
            </p>
