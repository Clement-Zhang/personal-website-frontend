                Hello there! I'm Clement Zhang, a Computer Science new graduate
                from Toronto Metropolitan University (formerly Ryerson
                University). I'm interested in software engineering and web
                development. I'm currently looking for a job. I made this
                website to showcase my skills in React. In the future, I will
                improve the pages and add more content.
            </p>

                You may notice that I use very little styling. In fact, the most
                noticeable styling is just the dark mode. My styling preferences
                are very minimalistic, so don't expect more than the minimum
                required styling to make major elements stand out from each
                other.
